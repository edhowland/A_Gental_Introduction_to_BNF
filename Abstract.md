Abstract

BNF or Backus Naur Form is a notational format for specifying the formal syntax
of a language. Popular in computer science for defining programming languages,
network protocols and text-based file formats, it has also seen wide
adoption in many other fields. BNF also has its own syntax rules making it
a sort of meta language; a language for defining other languages.
In this discussion, we will explore the origin, applications and real-world
examples of BNF as used in Unix. We will meet the many personalities who have
influenced and demonstrated the utility of this format.  Along the way, we will
introduce the underlying concepts of linguistics as applied to computers and
information systems.
