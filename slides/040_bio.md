# bio


I am a retired independent software engineer currently living in Kentwood, Mi.



## Early career

- First line of code: 1974: Dartmouth B.A.S.I.C.
  * Also Dartmouth time sharing service
- U.S. Navy Career
  * 8080/Z80 Assembly
  * COBOL
  * Fortran
  * PL/I
  * Tandy TRS-80 and Apple II BASIC
  * UCSD Pascal
- First developer job: 1985: Turbo Pascal + dBase II data store
- 3rd job: C/Unix @ AT&T Orlando, Fl.
  * Prevented from installing C++, hottest new language,  so our team did a "C with Classes"-lite version in the preprocessor
  * But, could use built-in tools like 'yacc' and 'lex'
- Spent the remainder of the time trying to understand grammars and BNF to this very day!
