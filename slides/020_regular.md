### Regular Languages

A language is regular over some alphabet (Sigma) if it is one of:

- Empty set
- A single symbol from Sigma
- A concatenation of any of the above
- A union of any the above
- A repetition  of 0 or more of any the above
- Parens are used to disambiguate the above

As defined by the mathematician  Stephen Cole Kleene.
