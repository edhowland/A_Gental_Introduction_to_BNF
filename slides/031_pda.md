### Push down Automata

CFGs are equivalent to pushdown automata (PDA).

A language is context free if, and only if, a PDA can be constructed to recognize
any legal string in that language. Conversely if a PDA exists for a given language
recognizer, a CFG can be constructed for it.

### Nondeterministic PDAs have more power than deterministic PDAs

Unlike their regular language NFA cousins which are exactly as powerful as their
DFA counterparts.
