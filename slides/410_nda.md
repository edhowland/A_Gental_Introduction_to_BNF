### Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)

Regular grammars are equivalent to DFAs.

A language is regular if, and only if, a deterministic finite automaton
can be constructed to recognize all, and only all, legal sentences in that language.
Conversely, if a DFA exists that can recognize legal strings in a regular language,
then a regular grammar can be constructed for it.
