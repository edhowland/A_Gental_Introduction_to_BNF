## Deterministic Finite Automata


Regular grammars are equivalent to DFAs.

A language is regular if, and only if, a deterministic finite automaton
can be constructed to recognize all, and only all, legal sentences in that language.
Conversely, if a DFA exists that can recognize legal strings in a regular language,
then a regular grammar can be constructed for it.

### Nondeterministic finite automata recognize regular languages, but are not more powerful than PDAs

Any NFA for a regular language can be mechanically be converted into a DFA
that recognizes the exact same language.

### Components of a DFA

- Q : Finite set of states
- Sigma : The input alphabet of symbols
- Q0 : The start state
- Delta : The delta function or lookup table
- F : The set of Final or accepting states. (subset of Q)



## Regular expressions

Regular expressions are another, albeit simpler, notation for regular grammars.
There exist some equivalent BNF for any Regexp. However, the reverse is NOT true!

Regexps can be converted to nondeterministic finite automate (NFA) much more
easily than to DFAs. However NFAs can be mechanically converted to DFAs.
