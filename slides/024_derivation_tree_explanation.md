### Explanation of derivation trees

Derivation trees are also known as parse trees or concrete syntax trees (CST).

### Forming a derivation tree

Such trees can be formed either top-down or bottom-up.
The root of this tree is the start symbol.
Child nodes are the nonterminals in the grammar as chosen for a given input sentence
Every nonterminal node and its immediate children consist of a sentential form for that part of the sentence.
Leaf nodes are exactly the terminals encountered inthe same order of the input.
