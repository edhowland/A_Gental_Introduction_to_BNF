# conclusion

Tonight we have discussed:

- Backus Naur Form: A meta language for denoting formal language languages
- The backstory of how and why BNF came to be.
  * The story of a new language: Algol-60 and John Backus and Peter Naur
- The syntax of BNF and its 2 newer versions: Extended BNF (EBNF) and Augmented BNF (ABNF)
- Language theory and its components: Lexical, Grammatical and Semantic
-  Classification of languages  as formalized by Noam Chomsky into 4 ladder rungs of a hierarchy.
- Regular languages and their grammars both BNF and Regular Expressions
- Context Free languages
- LL Grammars those that are accepted by top down parsers
- LR Grammars those that are accepted by bottom up parsers like those generated by YACC and its siblings
- Derivation trees also known by other names: CST and parse trees.
- Finite State Machines
- Deterministic Finite Automata: Accepts regular languages in linear time
- Push Down Automata: Accepts all Context Free languages
- Nondeterminism: Like the fork() Unix system call
- Epsilon: As part of nondeterminism, allows for immediate state transfers
