## Regular Languagess

Definition:
As defined by the mathematician  Stephen Cole Kleene:

A language is regular over some alphabet (Sigma) if it is one of:

- Empty set
- A single symbol from Sigma
- A concatenation of any of the above
- A union of any the above
- A repetition  of 0 or more of any the above


In regular expressions, certain symbols functions as operators for the above operations.
 Parens can be used to disambiguate any of the above constructs.

# Closure properties of Regular Languages

Regular languages are closed over the following types of operators:

- Set operations
  * Union
  * Intersection
  *  Complement
- Concatenation or epitition  "*"
- Reversal

Note, the last one is not called for much in Regular Expressions
