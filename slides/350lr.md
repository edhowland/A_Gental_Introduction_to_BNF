## LR Grammar

First invented by Knuth, D. in the 1960's

Starting with the right-most  nonterminal, derive its productions, and then
work right to left.

## LR parsers are usually shift/reduce state machines such as those generated by
YACC-like parser generators. E.g. Bison.

LR grammars are a larger subset of CFG grammars then LL grammars.



Because LR parsers are bottom up parsers, they normally have less backtracking.


LR parsers are deterministic  parsers that run in linear time.

### Downsides of LR parsers

- Hard to debug because generated state tables are not human readable
- State tables can become very large for complex grammar inputs.
  * This has led to a plethora of modifications: LALR (YACC), SLR, CLR .etc
