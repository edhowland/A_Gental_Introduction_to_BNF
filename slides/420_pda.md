## Push down Automata

CFGs are equivalent to pushdown automata (PDA).

PDAs are always nondeterministic

### Components of a PDA


- Q : Finite set of states
- Sigma : The input alphabet of symbols
- Gamma : The stack alphabet
- Q0 : The start state
- Delta : The delta function or lookup table
- F : The set of Final or accepting states. (subset of Q)






## The Stack

PDAs are essentially DFAs but with one additional appendage: The stack.

The stack turns the state machine into a O(M)  linear space complexity.

Realistically, a correct parse means that M will never larger than N/2.
However, in practice the stack must be able to grow without limit.
