### Push down Automata

CFGs are equivalent to pushdown automata (PDA).

A language is context free if, and only if, a PDA can be constructed to recognize
any legal string in that language. Conversely if a PDA exists for a given language
recognizer, a CFG can be constructed for it.

### Nondeterministic PDAs have more power than deterministic PDAs

Unlike their regular language NFA cousins which are exactly as powerful as their
DFA counterparts.

### Components of a PDA


- Q : Finite set of states
- Sigma : The input alphabet of symbols
  * Optionally: including Epsilon
- Gamma : The stack alphabet
  * Optionally: including Epsilon
- Q0 : The start state
- Delta : The delta function or lookup table
- F : The set of Final or accepting states. (subset of Q)

### The Stack

PDAs are essentially DFAs but with one additional appendage: The stack.

The stack turns the state machine into a O(M)  linear space complexity.
