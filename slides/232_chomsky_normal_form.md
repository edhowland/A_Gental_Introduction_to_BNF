## Chomsky Normal Form

For every CFL grammar that can bedefined with BNF,
there is an equivalent grammar defined by CNF or Chomsky Normal Form

Shows that BNF is not the only game in town.
- Not used outside academic circles.
- BNF can be translated into CNF mechanically
- Some parsers are easier to construct if they have been constructed from CNF
