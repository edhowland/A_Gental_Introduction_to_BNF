## Chomsky Normal Form

For every CFL grammar that can bedefined with BNF,
there is an equivalent grammar defined by CNF or Chomsky Normal Form

- Not used outside academic circles.
- BNF can be translated into CNF mechanically
- Some parsers are easier to construct if they have been constructed from CNF
