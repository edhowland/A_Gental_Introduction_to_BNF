## Early history

Although attempts to formalize languages goes back K's of years to the Sanskrit
days, it became a lot more interesting in the first half of the 20th century.

- Alonzo Church's Lambda Calculus is a symbol rewriting system
- Alan Turing's eponymous machinesare acceptors of legal strings as defined bysome grammar for a specific language
- Noam Chomsky linked the above with his classes of languages and their finite state machine acceptors

## The realization of the Church-Turing dream

From Colossus in the early 40's during WWII, to the first compilers  in the 50's,
there has been a steady drive toward higher and higher level machine
representation  of  computer programs.

Early assemblers, autocoders and compilers were hand made and specified by the
user's manual with plenty of examples. These bespoke implementations eventually
led to a clamoring for some standardizations. Algol-60 became a early attempt
to  be an international collaboration between notable CS pioneers.
