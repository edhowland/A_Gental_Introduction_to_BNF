## Section 3

The last section wherein we are discussing parsers


### Computational Mechanics

Based on Stephen Wolfram's book: A New Kind of Science


The basic thrust of his book is that the physical world can best be understood
as having at bottom a celluar automata substrate. IOW, if I understand his premise at all,
our world is made up of tiny little Turing machines.

Computational Mechanics as defined by Alan Turing in his paper

"On Computable Numbers and their application to the E problem" (sic)

## Turing Machines

### Finite State Machines

All turing machines are finite state machines (FSM), or Finite Automata (FA)

## Computation

The process by which a finite state machine  performs an computation over a given input.

## CM is the heart of all Computer Science



## Types of Finite Automata

- DFA : Deterministic Finite Automata
- NFA  : Nondeterministic Finite Automata

All FSMs are classified by the above 2 types


## Push Down Automata

PDAs have the additional property in that they have a stack for memory.
PDAs are thus more powerful than DFAs. PDAs are also nondeterministic
