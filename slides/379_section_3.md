## Section 3

The last section wherein we discussing parsers


### Computational Mechanics

Computational Mechanics aas defined by Alan Turing in his paper


"On Computable Numbers and their application to the E problem" (sic)

## Turing Machines

### Finite State Machines

All turing machines are finite state machines (FSM), or Finite Automata (FA)

## Computation

The process by which a finite state machine  performs an computation over a given input.

## CM is the heart of all Computer Science



## Types of Finite Automata

- DFA : Deterministic Finite Automata
- NFA  : Nondeterministic Finite Automata

All FSMs are classified by the above 2 types
