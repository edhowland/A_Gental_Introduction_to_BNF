# parsing

##### Key slide

Parsing is the act of scanning the input a singlelexical token at a time
and constructing a derivation tree based on the grammar and its type: LL or LR.




## State machines

State machines can be used to construct a parser for a given grammar.

## A grammar is said to be of a Chomsky type if, and only if, there is a matching type of state  machine for that Chomsky type.
