whoami ?

And how did I come to this topic?
Born in West Michigan.

Wrote my first line of code in my Junior year of H.S.
That was 48 years ago and incidently, the year that Unix 5th Edition or V5 Unix was released.
We had a Teletype terminal hooked to a 300 baud acoustically coupled modem connected to Grand Rapids Community College.
The mini? computer there was running Dartmouth BASIC.
In fact, I think it ran the eintire Dartmouth time sharing environment
That was possibly the first viral program in existence.
We had to try and save the LEM fromcreating the newest crater on the lunarsurface or
sending Neil and Buzz off intoa perpetual orbit around the moon.
I guess they had not packed enough sandwiches for that.
Hated every minute of it.
Swore off programming forever.
Besides it did not jive with my goal of becoming the first Missionary on Mars.
Not the first missionary to the Martians, but the first missionary on Mars to the astronauts already there.
Which, by the time I graduated from Bible college, surely would be a thriving colony.
