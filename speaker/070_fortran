That, and my next course, FORTRAN, required us students to submit our homework
using punch cards. Until a new sysop friend hooked me up with a login on the small I.B.M. mainframe.
I could not only use the interactive Fortran interpreter, but could either print out
my listings to either 14 inch fan-fold paper or even the card punch. I had an unfair
advantage over my fellow pupils.

I could not find a BNF for Fortran.



Next, we did PL/I or Programming Language/One.
No compiler there. Suspect the Navy was not a fan.
We just wrote out everything out on large grid paper. The Professor got some 
undergrads to punch them back at his home college.
