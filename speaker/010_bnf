Hello everyone. My name is Ed Howland.
I formally was an independent software engineer, but now I am just anotherrandom voice in the Cloud.
I am somewhere out there talking to you all here about BNF. Backus Naur Form.
Not Backus Normal Form, as you might have heard it called.

Thanks for coming out tonight and thanks to Jonathon for his help with thisevent.
I am extremely conscious of the Zoom fatigue we all have to endure. so, let me express my appreciation
that you came to listen to me tonight.

With that said, I'll try to keep this as short as possible.
We have X slides grouped in 3 main subject areas.

1. History of BNF
2. Language andlinguistics.
3. Computational Mechanics. Like Quantum Mechanics, but way cooler.

Let's shoot for about 45 minutes or so. We can expand or contract that
as desired.
