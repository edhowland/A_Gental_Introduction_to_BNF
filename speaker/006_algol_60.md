Algol 60
International collab to be the language for all time!


Virtual Whos Who of Comp Sci. Most Turing award winners
Amopng them:
N. Wirth, of whom I have already spoken
Alan Perliss: First prez of ACM. First winner of Turing award
Tony Hoare
  Of Algo said: It was better than all languages that came before and most that came after.
I probably butchered that.

Many innovative features features for its time
  * Pass by value, allowing for proper recursion
  * Nested block scoping
  * Lexical scoping
    ** That is the bility of some block to reach out its outer scope and reference a variable defined in that scope

Negative critism: No standard I/O
  * Each compiler vendor/computer manufactureer must specify their own
  * No universal "Hello World" program
  * Hard to write a cross platform library

Algol-60 was first lang to use it to specify its syntax
Donald K. Suggested it be renamed Backus Naur Form
