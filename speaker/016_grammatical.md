### Grammatical definition
Alone, words merely convey partial meanings
They prefer to run with the pack as it were. 
These wolf packs will gang up on an idea and torpedo it to the surface!
In common parlance we call these sentences.
Turns out sentences will become very important.

The Grammar or the syntax of a language is how we construct more elaborate units of meaning in our languages.

This level of language abstraction is where BNF actually does its work best.


One additional note:

For programming languages, when we perform a "syntax check", we are checking if the source is grammatically correct. IOW: does it obey the rules of our language?
