The entire file is a series of what are called rules
  * A rule has a Left hand side, the derives operator and the right hand side
The S or Start symbol
  * This is the first NonTerminal
  * Terminals are like atoms. They cannot be broken down further
  * Nonterminals are like molecules, they can be constructed with other terminals and form polymer-like chains
The derives operator
  * Sometimes this appears as just a single equal sign, or a single colon equals
  * Even a right pointing arrow
A right hand side of list of terminals and nonterminals
A verticle pipe signifiy an alternate rule
  * Might be just another instance of the nonterminal of the same type


And finally,   their might be an instance of a special terminal called Epsilon
  * I abbreviated this to Eps
  * Sometimes it appears as the actual Greek symbol: Epsilon
  * sometimes : three dots or  or ellipsis
We have a lot to go thru before I can really describe Epsilon!
  * It is ok to think of
