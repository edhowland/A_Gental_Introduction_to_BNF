I guess that all this unintended complexity resulted in some attempts to formallize or
standardize BNF. One such attempt is ABNF or Augemented BNF as proposed by the IETF
or the Internet Engineering Task Force, the body with oversight on standards we all rely on everyday.

The IETF, and other standards bodies, use a documentation process called "Request For Comment" or just RFC
In fact, there is even a RFC for ABNF, RFC 5324 which gets referenced
in other RFCs. Like the one for E-Mail or RFC 5322.

One notable difference between EBNF and ABNF, besides the syntax differences,is the ability to
exactly specify the precise range or single value of a repitition of nonterminals and terminals.

Just saying 1 or more of something is not enough if you really mean 1,2 or 3 of something
and no more than that.

We are NOT going to see many examples of ABNF here today. Links are provided in the 
README.md for this talk.

Note that the last 2 slides were not even Key slides. But the slide on just BNF
syntax was a key slide. Just knowing this muchabout POBNF will get yo by in most.
In documentation,, there is often some symbol key defining what the typographical notation used therein.
