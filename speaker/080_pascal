Fast forward to about 1985, I landed my first programming job.
It was using dBase II database and Turbo Pascal for the Text User Interface front
end.

Here is the BNF for Pascal. 

It was helpful that the book by N. Wirth: Data Structures + Algorithims
had a syntax diagram inside the back cover of the hardback.
