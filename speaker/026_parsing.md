### parsing
### State machines
Acceptors for any given grammar G oof language L are finite state machines.


Which type of FSM depends on which type of lang L actually is.

To review:

Type 3 langs are regular langs and only need a simple deterministic finite automon
Type 2 langs are context free langs but need a push down automaton.
