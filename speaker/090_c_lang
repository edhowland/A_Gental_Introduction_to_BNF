Moving ahead a few years to about the late 80's, I landed a job at AT&T in their
Orlando, FL office. Significant how by that time, all employees were connected to Unix
minicomputers like the 3B2 running Unix SystemV.

All of our coding was done in C and we were trying to improvethe performance of Bourne shell scripts
written mainly in sed+awk. As a side project, a couple of us weretrying to implement the original
progenitor of C++: C with classes. Although C++ was a Bell Labs invention,
it was not allowed in AT&T business units. C with classes was implemented using mainly the C
preprocessor. We followed the same steps and managed to get a working implementation
using C structs with attached methods implemented withfunction pointers.

While doing this, I tryed my first attempt at YACC and writing my first .y file. I bombed spectacularly!
The syntax of YACC source files followsclosely BNF notation
with the addition of semantic actions. These latter are enclosed in curly braces that
can contain C language code. They also contain positional Bourne shell-like
notation to extract the parsed strings found in the input. These can be used to 
construct an AST.





so, that was my introduction to BNF and grammars. It did not go so well.
If only I had attened  tonight's lecture, I might have been better armoured to tackle
the subject matter.

This is the BNF for C.
